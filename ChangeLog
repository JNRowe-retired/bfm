	* : Applied the gkrellm2 support patch from Debian's package, by
		Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>.
	* : Includes and installs the debian packages' manpage.
	* : Hacked in Linux 2.6 mem support from the bubblemon-dockapp-1.41 
		release.  Reads version from linux's version.h and builds
		accordingly.
	* : Hacked in OpenBSD compile time support from the 
		bubblemon-dockapp-1.4 release.
	* : Made GTK2 builds the default for both bubblefishymon and
		gkrellm.
	* : Bumped revision to 0.6.0 from the original 0.5.1 release on
		http://pigeond.net/bfm/.

	* : Applied patch from Huw Giddens to fix the memory usage routines
		for 2.6 kernels that still works for 2.4 kernels.  It is now
		possible to use the same binary with different kernels.
	* : Import of debian packaging dir, again from Huw Giddens.  Probably
		requires some fixing by someone with a Debian box, because 
		some of the Makefile changes have not been applied. [ PREFIX
		and "all" target].  And the "install" target changes have been
		taken under some duress.
