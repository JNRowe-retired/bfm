	* : Pull the NET_DEVICE variable in to the config section of the
		Makefile.  (suggestion from too many people to mention.)
	* : Fixes to all "-Wall" warnings.
	* : Fixed typo in PLUGIN_URL.
	* : Wow, so not only are there still C compilers out there that don't
		accept C++ style '//' comments, but there are people who use
		such compilers out there too. In all seriousness though, thanks
		to Teijo for finding such a system just to send a bug 
		report :P

	* : Adds a spin button and code so there can be a bubblefishymon
		update interval independent of gkrellm builtin updates.  I
		arbitrarily set to allow 10 - 50 updates per second.
	* : Put a callback on the prog_entry so that the apply_config
		function can be eliminated.  This totally converts the plugin
		to an instant apply config and it becomes the first plugin I
		know of that achieves this status!  You'll notice there are no
		longer the "Apply" and "Close" buttons appearing when the
		bubblefishymon config page is up.

	* : Applied patch from Huw Giddens to fix the memory usage routines
		for 2.6 kernels that still works for 2.4 kernels.  It is now
		possible to use the same binary with different kernels.
	* : Import of debian packaging dir, again from Huw Giddens.  Probably
		requires some fixing by someone with a Debian box, because 
		some of the Makefile changes have not been applied. [ PREFIX
		and "all" target].  And the "install" target changes have been
		taken under some duress.

	* : Applied the gkrellm2 support patch from Debian's package, by
		Sjoerd Simons <sjoerd@luon.net>.
	* : Includes and installs the debian packages' manpage.
	* : Hacked in Linux 2.6 mem support from the bubblemon-dockapp-1.41 
		release.  Reads version from linux's version.h and builds
		accordingly.
	* : Hacked in OpenBSD compile time support from the 
		bubblemon-dockapp-1.4 release.
	* : Made GTK2 builds the default for both bubblefishymon and
		gkrellm.
	* : Bumped revision to 0.6.0 from the original 0.5.1 release on
		http://pigeond.net/bfm/.
